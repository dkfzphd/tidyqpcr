The problem is exacerbated by a lack of sufficient experimental detail in many publications, which impedes a readerâ€™s ability to evaluate critically the quality of the results presented or to repeat the experiments.Content: The Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE) guidelines target the reliability of results to help ensure the integrity of the scientific literature, promote consistency between laboratories, and increase experimental transparency. MIQE is a set of guidelines that describe the minimum information necessary for evaluating qPCR experiments. Included is a checklist to accompany the initial submission of a manuscript to the publisher. By providing all relevant experimental conditions and assay characteristics, reviewers can assess the validity of the protocols used. Full disclosure of all reagents, sequences, and analysis methods is necessary to enable other investigators to reproduce results. MIQE details should be published either in abbreviated form or as an online supplement.Summary: Following these guidelines will encourage better experimental practice, allowing more reliable and unequivocal interpretation of qPCR results. }",

               Background
               Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) is a broadly used technique in the biomedical research. Currently, few different analysis models are used to determine the quality of data and to quantify the mRNA level across the experimental conditions.
            
            
               Methods
               We developed an R package to implement methods for quality assessment, analysis and testing qPCR data for statistical significance. Double Delta \textit{C}\textsubscript{\textit{T}} and standard curve models were implemented to quantify the relative expression of target genes from \textit{C}\textsubscript{\textit{T}} in standard qPCR control-group experiments. In addition, calculation of amplification efficiency and curves from serial dilution qPCR experiments are used to assess the quality of the data. Finally, two-group testing and linear models were used to test for significance of the difference in expression control groups and conditions of interest.
            
            
               Results
               Using two datasets from qPCR experiments, we applied different quality assessment, analysis and statistical testing in the pcr package and compared the results to the original published articles. The final relative expression values from the different models, as well as the intermediary outputs, were checked against the expected results in the original papers and were found to be accurate and reliable.
            
            
               Conclusion
               The pcr package provides an intuitive and unified interface for its main functions to allow biologist to perform all necessary steps of qPCR analysis and produce graphs in a uniform way.
